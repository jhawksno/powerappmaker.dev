## Hi, I'm James. I'm an IT Supervisor with 10+ years of web development experience with HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript, some PHP and a whole lot of WordPress.

In my role as IT Supervisor, I have started working a lot with SharePoint and the Power App Platorm, which includes Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, and Power Pages. You might say that I've become the SharePoint and Power Apps guy at the organization I work for. The more I work with these tools, the more I grow to love them. I've developed a passion for learning as much as I can about making Power Apps and developing beautiful SharePoint sites.
