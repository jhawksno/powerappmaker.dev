**PowerAppMaker.dev** is a personal blog for low code/no code, citizen developers and focuses on [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-ca/) and [SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration).

## About

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a highly customized version of the [Material Design theme](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/material-jekyll-theme) by [Alex Carpenter](https://github.com/alexcarpenter). It is currently hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I've modified the simple, clean layout of the original [Material Design theme](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/material-jekyll-theme) to use a CSS Grid layout with CSS Flexbox as support for various layout options.

## Work in Progress

This website is under development as it is a fun side project for me.
