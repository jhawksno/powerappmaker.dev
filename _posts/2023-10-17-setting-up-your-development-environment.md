One of the first things every developer needs to do is setup their development environment. The developement enivironment is a workspace with all of the tools needed to work on a coding project. It usually consists of a code editor, like [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), support for the programming language you want to use for your project and possibly a repository to store your project files. That's all fine and dandy, but how do you actually do this?

There is no shortage of options when it comes to code editors, programming languages, development frameworks, extensions and options for versioning control. It can get confusing and overwhemling very quickly. There are a lot of blogs, YouTube videos, user communities and documentation webstites that provide tutorials and support for these tools but they can also be frustrating to follow, leaving you more confused than anything. I've spent countless hours watching videos and reading tutorials and gone down a million rabbit holes, because I get caught up with learning about the next best thing and trying it out for myself. I feel like a real super hacker. It is tempting to want to try it all but take it from me, you end up spending more time trying to setup the perfect development environment while you completely neglect the actual project you are supposed to be working on.

Let's break down some of the basic tools that will make up your development environment.

## Code Editor

One of the most popular options and my personal code editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) but here are some other options you may want to explore:

* Atom
* Sublime Text
* Bluefish
* Vim
* Netbeans
* Notepad++
