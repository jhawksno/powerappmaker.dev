# Becoming a low-code developer

In this series, I will attempt to provide as much guidence as I can to help you on your journey from a complete low-code newbie to a total low-code super hacker. I'll share easy to follow tutorials, recommendations, tips and advice based on my own personal experiences, past and present, as I go through the same journey. I'll do my best to explain things in terms everyone can understand, and try to translate some of the more complicated instructions from sources like Microsoft Learn and GitHub into terms a 6-year old can follow.

I've decided to break up things up into a series of articles to keep everything organized and easy to follow. Over time, tools and resources for low-code developement will evolve so I will update the articles in this series as needed. If you come across any out-of-date information, please reach out to let me know.

## Roadmap

This series will be an ongoing work-in-progress. So this roadmap may change in the near future as I develop the roadmap.
